# Microsoft_Homepage_Clone

## Description 
The goal of this project is to build a simple clone version of the microsoft homepage.
The application uses HTML and CSS to represent the cloned web page.

### What technology did I use and why ?
This is just a frontend web application so I chose to keep it simple and just use HTML and CSS. The main reasons are 
* type of application: i needed the website to accurately represent the actual Microsoft website. HTML amd CSS are best suited for this simple and easy 
approach.

* scope: Without using JavaScript or any frameworks in this project allows me to increase the scope of my web application with little to no performance
issues or concerns about entropy

* good documentation: for a beginner like me, it is important that the tools that I use are well documented, so that I can understand the different componenets
I work with.

* popularity: HTML and CSS are commonly used languages that are beginner friendly and helps with any frameworks that one may decide to branch onto moving forward 
in their developer career.

### Key Features
* Show featured products
* View a list of services that Microsoft provide 
* Represents well formated web structure


### What challenges did I face, what did I learn?
* The biggest challange for me was being able to just look at the website and then have to determine what steps I would have to take inorder to achieve my final 
outcome.
* I learned how big of a part CSS plays in a website when it comes to the structure and how cleanly everything is displayed
